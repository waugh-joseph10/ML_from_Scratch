    "# Implementing Linear Regression from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through the step-by-step implementation of a simple linear regression model from scratch using Python. Linear regression is a fundamental technique in machine learning and statistics that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Our goal is to build a basic understanding of how linear regression works and create a functional model without relying on external libraries.\n",
