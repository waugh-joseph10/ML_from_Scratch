## Introduction

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the process of implementing fundamental machine learning algorithms using NumPy. By following along with these notebooks, you'll enhance your understanding of the algorithms' principles and gain insights into their behavior.

## Notebooks

Each notebook focuses on a specific machine learning algorithm and guides you through the step-by-step implementation process. The implemented algorithms include:

1. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/waugh-joseph10/ML_from_Scratch/blob/main/notebooks/Linear_Regression.ipynb)
2. [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/waugh-joseph10/ML_from_Scratch/blob/main/notebooks/Logistic_Regression.ipynb)
3. [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/waugh-joseph10/ML_from_Scratch/blob/main/notebooks/K_Nearest_Neighbors.ipynb)
4. Decision Trees
5. Support Vector Machines
6. Neural Networks (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

Feel free to explore the notebooks in the order that suits your learning journey.

## Installation

To run the notebooks in this repository, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following steps:

**Clone this repository:**

``` git clone waugh-joseph10/ML_from_Scratch ```
<br>
<br>
<br>
**Create a virtual environment (optional, but recommended):**
<br>
<br>
Run the following Python code below to create and activate a virtual environment (for Mac users, reference different steps)
<br>
<br>
<i>Generate a Virtual Environment 'ML_from_Scratch'</i>
<br>
``` python -m venv ML_from_Scratch ```
<br><br>
<i>Activate the Virtual Environment</i> 
<br>
``` source ML_from_Scratch/bin/activate ```
<br><br>
<i>Install the required packages to the new virtual environment from the requirements.txt file</i>
<br>
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
<br><br>

## Usage
After setting up the environment, you can launch any of the Jupyter notebooks to explore and run the notebooks. All Jupyter notebooks are located within the ```notebooks``` folder. Links to the notebooks are shown below:
